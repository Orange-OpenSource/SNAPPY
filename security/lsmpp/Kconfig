          This selects the Linux Security++ Framework which allows to execute
          eBPF programs dynamically in LSM hooks. These bpf programs can access
          helpers that can be dynamically added by the administrator. Thus, the
          security is more flexible and powerful than with the classical LSM
          architecture.

          If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config SECURITY_LSMPP_ENFORCE
        bool "Deny operations based on the evaluation of the attached programs"
        depends on SECURITY_LSMPP
        help
          eBPF programs attached to hooks can be used for both auditing and
          enforcement. Enabling enforcement implies that the evaluation result
          from the attached eBPF programs will allow and deny the operation
          guarded by the security hook.
